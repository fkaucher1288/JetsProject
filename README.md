# Jets Project

# Description
This is my third program created at Skill Distillery. It is the first time I implemented individual methods to be called on in my Main method to handle all my operations and make my code much easier to read and understand. The app is an array list of 5 different kinds of planes. The planes have individual characteristics but are all children classes of the plane class. The airfield class contains the array list where the planes are "parked." The user menu then gives the user 10 choices on actions ranging from listing the plane to adding or removing planes if the user chooses to. The final option on the menu allows the user to quit the program.

# What did I learn# JetsProject
I learned a lot about for each loops and implemented them for the first time, as well as the ease of use and readability when individual methods are created and ran in main to perform certain tasks. Using switch statements instead of for loops to traverse through my user menu also helped keep things readable and easily executable.
